World is in our hands today! Behind the doors, it is the technology which rules. Growing technological changes tend humans to take up the developed technologies. One among them is Quick Response Code (QR CODE).In this , we promote the utilisation of QR code to fetch information about different animal species in the Zoological Park as audio in different languages. QR reader in the mobile phones is used to detect the QR code of the animal and the relevant animalâ€™s information is displayed. It also navigates the shortest route to optimize the site coverage within the simulated time along with that It will act as personal assistant and we can also book vehcile to have a tour around the zoo .This model will be more efficient , effective to use and it is 
eco-friendly.
