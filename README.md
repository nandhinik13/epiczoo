World is in our hands today! Behind the doors, it is the technology which rules. Growing technological changes tend humans to take up the developed technologies. One among them is Quick Response Code (QR CODE).In this , we promote the utilisation of QR code to fetch information about different animal species in the Zoological Park as audio in different languages. QR reader in the mobile phones is used to detect the QR code of the animal and the relevant animalâ€™s information is displayed. It also navigates the shortest route to optimize the site coverage within the simulated time along with that It will act as personal assistant and we can also book vehcile to have a tour around the zoo .This model will be more efficient , effective to use and it is 
eco-friendly.

The new proposed plan for our scanner is the use of it in zoological parks . The QR codes will be installed near animal enclosures . When the QR codes are scanned , the tourists will get information about the particular animal in the enclosure , the gender , no of  such animals in the zoo , their scientific name , whether they r endangered or exotic species etc . QR codes are also installed near vehicle rental spot within the zoo . Scanning these will allow the use of vehicles that can be used to tranverse across the zoo if necessary . Additional infos like distance to certain exhibits , enclosures and other hotpots within the zoo can also be found when scanned near the vehicle rental area .
